# KISS Game - BDD Feature Documentation

## Tier-Based Development Approach

This project uses a tier-based development approach to manage scope and ensure steady progress toward a portfolio-quality game. Each tier represents a development phase with specific goals, timelines, and success criteria.

## Tier Structure

### 🎯 [Tier 0 - MVP](tier-0-mvp/) (Months 1-2)
**Portfolio Showcase Features**
- Complete, playable multiplayer strategy game
- Showcases key technologies: WebSockets, MySQL, JWT, Docker
- Professional dark infographic UI
- Core game loop: authentication → game creation → turn-based play → victory

### 🚀 [Tier 1 - Enhanced](tier-1-enhanced/) (Months 3-4)
**Advanced Game Mechanics**
- Combat system with tactical depth
- Multiple factions with unique abilities
- Ship customization and fleet management
- Diplomacy and alliance systems

### ⭐ [Tier 2 - Advanced](tier-2-advanced/) (Months 5-6)
**Polish and Innovation**
- Procedural map generation
- Tutorial and onboarding system
- Special events and challenges
- Professional-grade polish

### 🌟 [Tier 3 - Future](tier-3-future/) (Months 7+)
**Long-term Vision**
- Mobile platform support
- Advanced AI systems
- Community features
- Competitive gaming infrastructure

## Development Philosophy

### Focus on Tier 0 First
- **Complete Tier 0 before moving to Tier 1**
- Each tier builds on the previous tier's foundation
- Resist the temptation to jump ahead to "cool" features
- A working MVP is worth more than 50% of advanced features

### Portfolio-Driven Development
- Tier 0 is designed to showcase employable skills
- Code quality and architecture matter as much as features
- Document your technical decisions and trade-offs
- Prepare to demo and explain your implementation choices

### Iterative Improvement
- Features can move between tiers as priorities change
- Regular reassessment of scope and timeline
- User feedback drives feature prioritization
- Technical debt is addressed before moving to next tier

## Using This Documentation

### For Development
1. **Start with Tier 0** - Focus exclusively on MVP features
2. **Complete each BDD scenario** - Use scenarios to guide implementation
3. **Track progress** - Check off acceptance criteria as features are completed
4. **Move features** - Relocate features between tiers as needed

### For Portfolio Presentation
- **Tier 0** demonstrates core full-stack development skills
- **Architecture docs** show system design capabilities
- **BDD scenarios** demonstrate requirements analysis skills
- **Code organization** shows project management abilities

## Success Metrics

### Tier 0 Success
- [ ] Complete, playable game with 2-4 players
- [ ] Real-time features working smoothly
- [ ] Professional UI that impresses employers
- [ ] Clean, documented codebase
- [ ] Deployed and demonstrable application

### Overall Project Success
- [ ] Portfolio piece that leads to job interviews
- [ ] Technical skills demonstration across full stack
- [ ] Sustainable codebase for future development
- [ ] Fun game that people actually want to play
- [ ] Foundation for potential commercial development

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Design Philosophy](../design-philosophy.md)** - Understand the creative vision
2. **Review [Tier 0 MVP](tier-0-mvp/)** - Your immediate development focus
3. **Set up development environment** - Docker, database, etc.
4. **Start with authentication** - First feature in the tier
5. **Build incrementally** - Complete each feature before moving to the next

Remember: **A completed Tier 0 is infinitely more valuable than a partially completed Tier 2.**
