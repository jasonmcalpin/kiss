## BDD Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Consistent Dark Infographic Color Scheme
**Given** I am viewing any page of the game  
**When** I look at UI elements (buttons, panels, text)  
**Then** colors should follow a professional dark theme palette  
**And** background should be dark (#0A0A0A to #1A1A1A)  
**And** text should be high-contrast white (#FFFFFF) or accent colors  
**And** accent colors should be used strategically for data hierarchy  

### Scenario 2: Subtle Interactive Feedback
**Given** I am viewing a button or interactive element  
**When** I hover over the element  
**Then** it should show subtle highlighting within 50ms  
**And** the highlight should be clean and professional  
**When** I click the element  
**Then** it should provide immediate visual feedback  
**And** the action should complete within 100ms  

### Scenario 3: Clean Data-Optimized Typography
**Given** I am viewing any text in the game  
**When** I examine headings, body text, and UI labels  
**Then** all text should use clean, readable fonts optimized for data display  
**And** font sizes should follow a consistent hierarchy  
**And** text should have excellent contrast against dark backgrounds  
**And** monospace fonts should be used for numerical data and statistics  

### Scenario 4: Dashboard-Style Grid Layout
**Given** I am viewing the game interface  
**When** I examine the layout structure  
**Then** all elements should align to a professional grid system  
**And** spacing should be consistent like an analytics dashboard  
**And** panels should have clean, rectangular shapes  
**And** layout should prioritize information clarity over decoration  

### Scenario 5: Informative Loading and Progress States
**Given** I trigger an action that requires loading  
**When** the system is processing  
**Then** I should see a clean progress indicator  
**And** the indicator should show meaningful progress information  
**And** loading states should use the dark theme color palette  
**And** animations should be smooth and purposeful at 60fps  

### Scenario 6: Professional Mobile Experience
**Given** I am viewing the game on a mobile device  
**When** I interact with the interface  
**Then** all visual elements should maintain the dark infographic aesthetic  
**And** touch targets should be appropriately sized for data interaction  
**And** text should remain highly readable  
**And** the professional dashboard feel should be preserved  

### Scenario 7: Clear Visual Feedback for Game Actions
**Given** I perform a game action (move ship, attack, etc.)  
**When** the action is executed  
**Then** I should see immediate, clear visual confirmation  
**And** the feedback should use subtle highlighting and color changes  
**And** colors should clearly indicate success, warning, or error states  
**And** animations should complete within 200ms without being distracting  

### Scenario 8: Accessible Dark Theme Design
**Given** I am a user with visual accessibility needs  
**When** I use the game interface  
**Then** contrast ratios should meet WCAG AA standards  
**And** the dark infographic aesthetic should be preserved  
**And** focus indicators should be clearly visible with high contrast  
**And** text should be scalable without breaking the professional layout
