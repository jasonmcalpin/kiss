## History
10,000 years ago an evil empire took over the galaxy. They surpressed all other technology but theirs and prevented anyone from leaving their homeworlds. The people of the galaxy waited. For despite their power and control they were selfish and over time their empires power crumbled. their armies grew weak and their ships never changed. stuck in time least some new technology gave advantage to their rivals in their empire. In the end a civil war broke out and suddenly the empire was gone. their forces scattered and confused and too paranoid to help each other. It is now that time when everyone is racing to claim freedom and a part of the galaxy for themselves. 

## Setting
The game is about creating an empire of your own. will it be a trade empire or a military one? Will you join forces or go it alone? The choice is yours. Each player will start on a random homeworld and can choose a special ability. Name your race and create a flag to represent your empire. You can explore the galaxy, build ships, colonize worlds and trade with other players. Watchout the old empire may still have a few ships out there protecting planets or resouces. 

The goal is to build up your forces before the empire returns to survive.

## Feel
The game is called KISS. So for some fun lets and at the end the fleet commander will blow a kiss and wave goodbye when the player loses. When they win the commander will blow a kiss and clap well done. I want something distinctive and fun to make it stand out.
