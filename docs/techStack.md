## Database and API
- **Database**: MySQL since my host has MySQL services i can use at no additional cost and allow people to reach it from anywhere.
- **API**: PHP. Again the Host can run PHP and has no way to run node.js or other server side languages. 
- **User Authentication**: PHP sessions and cookies for user authentication. This will allow users to log in and maintain their session across the site? I have to see how well this can be secured and work with what we need.
