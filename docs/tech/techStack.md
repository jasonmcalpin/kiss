## Database and API
- **Database**: MySQL since my host has MySQL services i can use at no additional cost and allow people to reach it from anywhere.
- **API**: Python. with the host able to run python I will use FastAPI to create a RESTful API for the game. This is a modern system that I already have some game code written for the universe generation, name generation and alien races which I can expand from the Traveller RPG character generator I expanded.  
- **User Authentication**: FastAPI with JWT for secure user authentication and session management.
