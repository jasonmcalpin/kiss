# KISS Game Design Philosophy

## Core Vision
- **Player Want**: Strategic depth and community
- **My Vision**: Dark infographic aesthetic and clean simplicity
- **Synthesis**: Deep strategy with minimalist, data-driven presentation

## Design Principles
1. **Complexity hidden behind simplicity** - Rich mechanics, clean UI
2. **Style over realism** - Clean infographics trump photorealism
3. **Respect player time** - Quick turns, clear feedback, efficient interactions
4. **Elegant solutions** - One good way to do things, not five mediocre ways
5. **Information clarity** - Data should be beautiful and immediately understandable

## Aesthetic Vision: Dark Infographic Style
- **Color Palette**: Dark backgrounds with strategic accent colors for data hierarchy
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts that work well for both UI and data display
- **Visual Elements**: Charts, graphs, and data visualizations as core design language
- **Layout**: Grid-based, organized like a sophisticated dashboard
- **Iconography**: Simple, clear symbols that convey information quickly
- **Contrast**: High contrast for readability, strategic color use for emphasis

## Decision Framework
When features conflict, ask:
1. **Does it fit the dark infographic aesthetic?** (Your creative vision)
2. **Does it serve strategic gameplay?** (Player core need)
3. **Does it build community?** (Player social need)
4. **Can we synthesize all three?** (The ideal solution)

### Example Applications:
- **Resource Display**: Not just numbers, but elegant charts showing trends
- **Fleet Management**: Clean data tables with visual indicators
- **Diplomacy**: Clear proposal layouts that look like professional documents
- **Victory Progress**: Dashboard-style progress indicators

## Core Values
- **Clarity over decoration** - Every visual element should serve a purpose
- **Efficiency over flashiness** - Smooth, fast interactions beat elaborate animations
- **Intelligence over complexity** - Smart defaults and helpful automation
- **Community over competition** - Foster cooperation alongside strategic conflict

## What This Means for Development
- UI components should look like they belong in a high-end analytics dashboard
- Color choices should prioritize information hierarchy over visual appeal
- Animations should be subtle and purposeful, not distracting
- Every screen should feel like it's helping players make informed decisions
- The game should feel sophisticated and professional, not gamey or childish
